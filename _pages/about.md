Hi! I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [ECE](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en), [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/). I am currently advised by [Prof. Jaewoong Sim](https://jaewoong.org/) and a member of the Computer Architecture and Systems Lab. <br />
I received my B.S degree from [Seoul National University](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en) (2023).

I have general research interests in building efficient AI systems, low-bit quantization, and accelerator systems for emerging workloads. I am the author of several top architecture/system conference papers including ISCA, OSDI, and ASPLOS.

If you have anything to discuss or questions about my work, feel free to contact me via [jungi.lee@snu.ac.kr](mailto:jungi.lee@snu.ac.kr).
